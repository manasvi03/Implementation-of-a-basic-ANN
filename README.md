# Implementation-of-a-basic-ANN

This is a very basic implementation of an Aritificial Neural Network using a real world example.

The following implementation will walk you through the whole process of Importing the libraries, data preprocessing, initializing the ANN, Building the ANN, 
training the ANN, predicting the output and checking the accuracy.
